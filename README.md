### travis-ci: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdisalvo/grndctl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mdisalvo/grndctl)

### grndctl - a springbooted app, hosted on Heroku that provides aerodrome information as provided by the National Weather Service.  
- "Why do this?", you may ask...  
    - It simplifies the calls required to make to the NWS repositories, and...
    - It returns JSON in lieu of XML, two things I saw some value in.
- Additionally, with my background as an FAA Certified Dispatcher and being rather new to programming, I thought this might be a fun way to test my skills putting together a public service with a CI/CD pipeline.
